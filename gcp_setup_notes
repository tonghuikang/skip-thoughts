No more sudo pip2 install package,  because need to ```sudo -i``` to start jupyter notebook. I am addicted to jupyter notebook because I want to see the result being saved. This will screw things up later.

Using wrapper install instead, based on fastai setup script. For GPU setup I referred to Timothy's GPU script. I don't have one prepared yet to do both.


ISSUE - GPU driver is new, device=cuda wasn’t installed at that time. But new drivers cannot utilise device=gpu0 properly. Therefore http://deeplearning.net/software/libgpuarray/installation.html 


Couldn’t condo install (thanks Tim), therefore need to build from sources :(


```sudo apt install cmake
pip2 install Cython --user
pip2 install nose --user
pip2 install mkl --user


git clone https://github.com/Theano/libgpuarray.git
cd libgpuarray


rm -rf ~/.local/lib/libgpuarray* ~/.local/include/gpuarray
rm -rf build Build
mkdir Build
cd Build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/.local -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make
make install
DEVICE="cuda" make test

cd ..

# Run the following export and add them in your ~/.bashrc file
export CPATH=$CPATH:~/.local/include
export LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH:~/.local/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/.local/lib

python2 setup.py build
python2 setup.py install --user
cd
DEVICE="cuda" python2 -c "import pygpu;pygpu.test()"```

The tensorflow part - I didn't install tensorflow properly. OMG I still haven't get this sorted out.

# Screw that install from here directly

In the end I still don't know how to use GPU :(
Anyway what I learnt is that the ```vectors = encoder.encode(X)``` is a bad prediction for semantic similarity. (I don't think it is meant for it?)
